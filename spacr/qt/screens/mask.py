"""Timelapse segmentation and tracking controls integrated with Mask.

The Timelapse switch enables ``timelapse=True`` for the standard mask
pipeline and displays the additional time-series and tracking settings on the
Mask form. Settings files created for the Timelapse module remain compatible;
:func:`sync_folds` restores the switch state from the pipeline gate.

The integrated tracking preview evaluates object linkage across frames,
whereas the standard Mask preview evaluates segmentation of an individual
field. Motility analysis remains under Measure because it quantifies existing
masks and writes measurements rather than generating masks.

Category mounting and fold-state synchronization are shared with the other
host screens through :mod:`spacr.qt.screens.map_barcodes`.

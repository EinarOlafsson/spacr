# Notes from `spacr/qt/widgets/gate_search_panel.py`

Prose lifted out of `spacr/qt/widgets/gate_search_panel.py` by `tools/extract_source_notes.py`.
The module itself carries no comments now, so this file is where its reasons live; the path mirrors the source path, which is how it is found.

Entries are grouped by the function or class they sat in and carry the line they came from. Line numbers are from the state of the module when the notes were taken, so they drift; the quoted code line is the durable anchor.

## GateSearchPanel.__init__

### lines 122-124

```python
from ..screens.settings_model import retarget_field_tooltips
```

Hover help belongs on a setting's NAME, not on the field the user is about to type into (instruction 113). One post-pass rather than a convention every hand-built row has to remember.

Welcome to SpaCr
================

The spatial organization of structures and proteins within cells constitutes a key level of functional regulation. Pooled CRISPR-Cas9 screens have emerged as powerful functional genomic tools. However such screens typically rely on aggregate-level outputs such as bulk selection or sequencing, which limits their ability to capture finer-grained, spatially resolved phenotypes. Here, we developed spatial phenotype analysis of CRISPR-Cas9 screens (spaCR), a broadly applicable Python-based software package for analyzing pooled CRISPR-Cas9 imaging screens. spaCR provides a flexible toolkit to extract single-cell images and measurements from high-content cell painting experiments, train machine-learning/ deep-learning models to classify subcellular phenotypes, map sequencing data, and correlate genotypes to phenotypes. Using spaCR, we integrated well-level genotype annotation with single-cell phenotype data from host cells infected by CRISPR-Cas9 Toxoplasma mutants to determine how the parasite recruits host TSG101 to its intracellular niche. Multiple linear regression identified both established and previously uncharacterized genetic determinants of this spatial phenotype. These findings establish spaCR as a powerful new tool to define the genetic basis of spatial phenotypes in cells.

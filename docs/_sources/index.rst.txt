Welcome to SpaCr
================

**spaCR** (Spatial Phenotype Analysis of CRISPR Screens) is a Python toolkit for analyzing pooled CRISPR-Cas9 imaging screens. It integrates high-content imaging data with sequencing-based mutant identification to enable genotype-to-phenotype mapping at the single-cell level.

spaCR provides a modular and extensible framework that supports:

- **Segmentation** of microscopy images using models like Cellpose.
- **Single-cell feature extraction** and image cropping.
- **Classification** of phenotypes using classical and deep learning models.
- **Barcode decoding** from sequencing reads and well-level mutant quantification.
- **Statistical analysis**, including regression models to link genotypes to phenotypes.
- **Interactive visualization** of results including Grad-CAMs and phenotype maps.
- **GUI tools** for mask curation, annotation, and exploratory analysis.

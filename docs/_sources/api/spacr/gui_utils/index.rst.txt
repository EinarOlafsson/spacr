.. py:function:: initialize_cuda()

   Initializes CUDA for the main process if a compatible GPU is available.

   This function checks if CUDA is available on the system. If it is, it allocates
   a small tensor on the GPU to ensure that CUDA is properly initialized. A message
   is printed to indicate whether CUDA was successfully initialized or if it is not
   available.

   .. note::

      This function is intended to be used in environments where CUDA-enabled GPUs
      are present and PyTorch is installed.

   Prints:
       - "CUDA initialized in the main process." if CUDA is available and initialized.
       - "CUDA is not available." if no compatible GPU is detected.


.. py:function:: set_high_priority(process)

   Sets the priority of a given process to high.

   On Windows systems, the process priority is set to HIGH_PRIORITY_CLASS.
   On Unix-like systems, the process priority is adjusted to a higher level
   by setting its niceness value to -10.

   :param process: The process whose priority is to be adjusted.
   :type process: psutil.Process

   :raises psutil.AccessDenied: If the current user does not have permission to change
       the priority of the process.
   :raises psutil.NoSuchProcess: If the specified process does not exist.
   :raises Exception: For any other errors encountered during the operation.

   .. rubric:: Notes

   - This function requires the `psutil` library to interact with system processes.
   - Adjusting process priority may require elevated privileges depending on the
     operating system and user permissions.


.. py:function:: set_cpu_affinity(process)

   Set the CPU affinity for a given process to use all available CPUs.

   This function modifies the CPU affinity of the specified process, allowing
   it to run on all CPUs available on the system.

   :param process: A psutil.Process object representing the process
                   whose CPU affinity is to be set.
   :type process: psutil.Process

   :raises psutil.NoSuchProcess: If the process does not exist.
   :raises psutil.AccessDenied: If the process cannot be accessed due to insufficient permissions.
   :raises psutil.ZombieProcess: If the process is a zombie process.


.. py:function:: proceed_with_app(root, app_name, app_func)

   Prepares the application window to load a new app by clearing the current
   content frame and initializing the specified app.

   :param root: The root window or parent container that
                contains the content frame.
   :type root: tk.Tk or tk.Toplevel
   :param app_name: The name of the application to be loaded (not used in
                    the current implementation but could be useful for logging or
                    debugging purposes).
   :type app_name: str
   :param app_func: A function that initializes the new application
                    within the content frame. It should accept the content frame as
                    its only argument.
   :type app_func: callable

   Behavior:
       - Destroys all widgets in the `content_frame` attribute of `root`
         (if it exists).
       - Calls `app_func` with `root.content_frame` to initialize the new
         application.

   .. note::

      Ensure that `root` has an attribute `content_frame` that is a valid
      tkinter container (e.g., a `tk.Frame`) before calling this function.


.. py:function:: load_app(root, app_name, app_func)

   Load a new application into the GUI framework.

   This function handles the transition between applications in the GUI by
   clearing the current canvas, canceling scheduled tasks, and invoking
   exit functionality for specific applications if necessary.

   :param root: The root object of the GUI, which contains the canvas,
                after_tasks, and other application state.
   :param app_name: The name of the application to load.
   :type app_name: str
   :param app_func: The function to initialize the new application.
   :type app_func: callable

   Behavior:
       - Clears the current canvas if it exists.
       - Cancels all scheduled `after` tasks associated with the root object.
       - If the current application has an exit function and the new app is
         not "Annotate" or "make_masks", the exit function is invoked before
         proceeding to the new application.
       - Proceeds to load the new application using the provided `app_func`.

   .. note::

      The `proceed_with_app` function is used internally to finalize the
      transition to the new application.

   :rtype: tuple

   :raises Exception: If an error occurs while creating the input field.


.. py:function:: process_stdout_stderr(q)

   Redirects the standard output (stdout) and standard error (stderr) streams
   to a queue for processing.

   This function replaces the default `sys.stdout` and `sys.stderr` with
   instances of `WriteToQueue`, which write all output to the provided queue.

   :param q: A queue object where the redirected output will be stored.
   :type q: queue.Queue


.. py:class:: WriteToQueue(q)

   Bases: :py:obj:`io.TextIOBase`

      This is a no-op in this implementation.



.. py:function:: cancel_after_tasks(frame)

   Cancels all scheduled 'after' tasks associated with a given frame.

   This function checks if the provided frame object has an attribute
   named 'after_tasks', which is expected to be a list of task IDs
   scheduled using the `after` method (e.g., in a Tkinter application).
   If such tasks exist, it cancels each of them using the `after_cancel`
   method and then clears the list.

   :param frame: An object (typically a Tkinter widget) that may have an
                 'after_tasks' attribute containing scheduled task IDs.

   :raises AttributeError: If the frame does not have the required methods
       (`after_cancel` or `after_tasks` attribute).


.. py:function:: load_next_app(root)

   Loads the next application by invoking the function stored in the `next_app_func`
   attribute of the provided `root` object. If the current root window has been
   destroyed, a new root window is initialized before invoking the next application.

   :param root: The current root window object, which contains the attributes
                `next_app_func` (a callable for the next application) and
                `next_app_args` (a tuple of arguments to pass to the callable).
   :type root: tk.Tk

   :raises tk.TclError: If the root window does not exist and needs to be reinitialized.


.. py:function:: convert_settings_dict_for_gui(settings)

   Each key in the input dictionary is mapped to a tuple of the form:
   (input_type, options, default_value), where:

   - input_type (str): The type of GUI element. One of:
       * 'combo' for dropdown menus
       * 'check' for checkboxes
       * 'entry' for entry fields
   - options (list or None): A list of selectable options for 'combo' types, or None for other types.
   - default_value: The current or default value to be displayed in the GUI.

   Special keys are mapped to pre-defined configurations with known option sets
   (e.g., 'metadata_type', 'channels', 'model_type').

   :param settings: Dictionary where keys are setting names and values are their current values.
   :type settings: dict

   :return: Dictionary mapping setting names to tuples for GUI rendering.
